Mozilla Firefox offers a Do Not Track feature that lets you express a preference not to be tracked by websites
Do Not Track FAQ
Your Status
Do Not Track is ON
Do Not Track is OFF
Mozilla is a global nonprofit organization dedicated to making the Web better We emphasize principle over profit and believe that the Web is a shared public resource to be cared for not a commodity to be sold We answer to no one but you and believe it is crucial to put you in control of your online experience We are aiming to give you better insight and control into the ways your personal information is collected used stored and shared online
Mozilla Firefox offers a Do Not Track feature that lets you express a preference not to be tracked by websites When the feature is enabled Firefox will tell advertising networks and other websites and applications that you want to optout of tracking for purposes like behavioral advertising
Frequently Asked Questions
What is Do Not Track
Do Not Track is a step toward putting you in control of the way your information is collected and used online Do Not Track is a feature in Firefox that allows you to let a website know you would like to optout of thirdparty tracking for purposes including behavioral advertising It does this by transmitting a Do Not Track HTTP header every time your data is requested from the Web
Is Do Not Track available on Firefox for Android
Yes Firefox for Android is the first mobile Web browser to offer the Do Not Track privacy feature and behaves the same way it does on the desktop To turn Do Not Track on in Firefox for Android simply swipe left and tap on Browser Tools From the Preferences pane tap on the box next to Tell sites not to track me to turn this option on or off
Does Do Not Track block ads
No you will still see ads with Do Not Track enabled However Do Not Track may change the type of ads you see For example behavioral ads are targeted to your interests based on the websites you visit and the search terms you use If you request that websites Do Not Track you and the sites respect your privacy preferences you will see more generic ads in place of behavioral ads
How does Do Not Track work with other privacy tools
Do Not Track is one of many privacy solutions Do Not Track does not replace your antivirus software will not encrypt data and is not a security mechanism There are several other privacy and security features within Firefox
Will Do Not Track affect the rest of my Web experience
Do Not Track may interfere with some personalized services you enjoy For example a Do Not Track request might mean you would have to type in your zip code each time you want to view a weather report rather than seeing the weather automatically displayed Personalization on websites can save you time and repetitive typing but it requires data
How do I enable Do Not Track in Firefox
This feature is not enabled by default You can find the Do Not Track request on the Privacy pane On Windows go to Tools  Options  Privacy
On macOS go to Firefox  Preferences  Privacy On Linux go to Edit  Preferences  Privacy
On Mac OS X go to Firefox  Preferences  Privacy On Linux go to Edit  Preferences  Privacy
Click to check the box next to Tell websites I do not want to be tracked For more information see the help file on how to stop websites from tracking you
Will companies honor my Do Not Track preference
Companies are starting to support Do Not Track but you may not notice any changes initially We are actively working with companies that have started to implement Do Not Track with others who have committed to doing so soon

Geolocation in Firefox
LocationAware Browsing
Firefox can tell websites where you’re located so you can find info that’s more relevant and more useful It’s about making the Web smarter  and is done in a way that totally respects your privacy Give it a try
Frequently asked Questions
What is LocationAware Browsing
Websites that use locationaware browsing will ask where you are in order to bring you more relevant information or to save you time while searching Let’s say you’re looking for a pizza restaurant in your area A website will be able to ask you to share your location so that simply searching for pizza will bring you the answers you need no further information or extra typing required
Or if you’re mapping out directions to get somewhere the website will know where you’re starting from so all you have to do is tell it where you want to go
This service is totally optional  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission  and is done with the utmost respect for your privacy And like all elements of Firefox it’s being created using open standards to ease adoption by Web developers
How does it work
When you visit a locationaware website Firefox will ask you if you want to share your location
If you consent Firefox gathers information about nearby wireless access points and your computer’s IP address Then Firefox sends this information to the default geolocation service provider Google Location Services to get an estimate of your location That location estimate is then shared with the requesting website
If you say that you do not consent Firefox will not do anything
How accurate are the locations
Accuracy varies greatly from location to location In some places our service providers may be able to provide a location to within a few meters However in other areas it might be much more than that All locations returned by our service providers are estimates only and we do not guarantee the accuracy of the locations provided Please do not use this information for emergencies Always use common sense
What information is being sent and to whom How is my privacy protected
Your privacy is extremely important to us and Firefox never shares your location without your permission When you visit a page that requests your information you’ll be asked before any information is shared with the requesting website and our thirdparty service provider
By default Firefox uses Google Location Services to determine your location by sending
your computer’s IP address
information about the nearby wireless access points and
a random client identifier which is assigned by Google that expires every  weeks
For a complete description of information collected and used by Firefox please see the Firefox Privacy Notice
Google Location Services then returns your estimated geolocation eg latitude and longitude For a complete description of information collected and used by Google please see the Google Geolocation Privacy Policy
The information is exchanged over an encrypted connection to protect your privacy Once Firefox has your location information it passes it to the website that requested it At no time is the name or location of the website you are visiting or are any cookies ever shared with Google Location Services
Neither Mozilla or Google will ever use the information collected by Google Location Services to identify or spy on you
For information about what the requesting website does with your location information please refer to that website’s privacy policy
For more information about your privacy you should also read
Mozilla Firefox Privacy Notice
Google privacy policy
Am I being tracked as I browse the web
No Firefox only requests a location when a website makes a request and only shares your location when the user has approved the request Firefox does not track or remember your location as you browse
How do I undo a permission granted to a site
If you've given Firefox permission to always give your location to a site and later change your mind you can easily revoke that permission Here's how
Navigate to the site to which you’ve given permission
Go to the Tools menu then select Page Info
Select the Permissions tab
Change the setting for Share Location
How do I clear the random client identification number
Go to the Tools menu then select Clear Recent History
Click the Details arrow
Ensure that Cookies is selected
Click on Clear Now
How do I turn off LocationAware Browsing permanently
LocationAware Browsing is always optin in Firefox No location information is ever sent without your permission If you wish to disable the feature completely please follow this set of steps
In the URL bar type aboutconfig
Type geoenabled
Double click on the geoenabled preference
LocationAware Browsing is now disabled
How can I add support for Geolocation to my web site
You can integrate Geolocation support into your service by following the instruction at Mozilla Developer Center

Mozilla’s advocacy engine works with allies to cultivate a global force of tens of millions of people who are aware of the issues that are vital to the future of the open Internet and prepared to take action in support of the rights of citizens of the web
We are dedicated to building a world where
People are making more conscious choices to build and protect the open Internet
Companies and governments create products policies and laws to support the open Internet because of public pressure to do s
How we work A focus on depth and scale
Mozilla’s advocacy approach incorporates both scale to depth and depth to scale to properly address the diversity of issues that we work on
This approach enables Mozilla to simultaneously build our capacity to mobilize millions of people quickly and grow our organizing power in local communities which will make it possible to win on our issues in the longterm

Mozilla‘s vision of the Internet is a place where anyone can access information a place where everyone can hack and tinker one that has openness freedom and transparency where users have control over their personal data and where all minds have the freedom to create and to consume without walls or tight restrictions
In less than  years the Internet has changed our lives It is a powerful platform with unprecedented opportunity and connectedness But even with great growth and innovation there are significant challenges to this vision of a healthy Internet
Mozilla is mobilized to ensure the protection of the Web and to empower tomorrow’s webmakers and Web users Today Mozilla is growing  with more employees contributors products and locations  to ensure that the Web remains an open vibrant ecosystem Because the Web is the platform for building the world we want
Please explore this site to learn more about Mozilla our priorities and focus areas that enable us to ensure the healthy growth of this large and precious global resource
Mozilla Mobilized
Mozilla is mobilizing millions of people to build the world they want Mobilizing to set the mobile Web free from proprietary platforms and gatekeepers Mobilizing to empower the world's next two billion Web users And mobilizing to build a new generation of digital innovators creators and webmakers
Moving forward we will continue to focus on building products technology solutions and educational offerings that incorporate Mozilla values into the Web Today Mozilla’s mission remains as important as ever From Firefox through Firefox OS to our new Mozilla Webmaker educational offering the goal is empowerment It’s about unlocking the full creative power of mobile standing up for user sovereignty privacy and freedom and helping millions of people move from using the Web to actively building its future
Just like we did on the desktop Mozilla is setting out to ensure that the mobile Web is full of freedom choice  opportunity
Just like we did on the desktop Mozilla is setting out to ensure that the mobile Web is full of freedom choice and opportunity and that it has the ability for users to create anything they want With Firefox OS we can break open the world of native operating systems and closed platforms once again
Firefox OS is the first truly open mobile platform Developers are already embracing HTML but so far HTML applications on mobile have been held back because they can’t access the device’s underlying capabilities the way that native apps can Firefox OS overcomes these limitations and provides the necessary APIs to show how it is possible to run an entire device using open standards
Firefox OS devices will launch in early  through Telefónica establishing HTML as a viable platform for the mobile industry The Web as the platform will free developers to create groundbreaking new apps that work seamlessly across all devices spurring a new era of innovation and creativity for the ubiquitous Web
Fast
Smart
Safe
In June  we released an update to Firefox for Android that we believe is the best browser for Android available We completely rebuilt and redesigned the product in native UI resulting in a snappy and dynamic upgrade to mobile browsing that is significantly faster than the Android stock browser This made Firefox significantly faster on Android and delivered a much better browsing experience to users than the one offered by the device’s stock browser We also added Do Not Track to Firefox for Android to let users express their intent for privacy even on mobile and are the first mobile browser to offer Do Not Track Firefox for Android is a critical part of supporting the open Web This is a great start but it is only a start We want these opportunities to exist at all layers of our Web experience
Firefox for Windows Mac and Linux
Firefox will always be the part of the Mozilla mission that people can see feel and touch
Firefox will always be the part of the Mozilla mission that people can see feel and touch We are excited by the progress and innovation we have seen with the desktop version of Firefox over the past year Several performance and security improvements memory enhancements make this the best Firefox yet We're proud of the work that we're doing to make developing on Firefox easier by adding exciting tools for developers like Developer Command Line Web Console and Tilt the D Page Inspector
Recently we have been experimenting with ways to integrate social functionality into Firefox Firefox will support a new Social API that lets developers integrate social services directly into the browser The Social API will support multiple providers and has endless potential for integrating social networks email finance news and other applications into your Firefox experience Our first experimental provider is Facebook
Webmaker Teaching the world the Web
The unique power of the Web is that anyone can make and build with it
The unique power of the Web means that anyone can make and build with it Our new educational offering Mozilla Webmaker will place that power in the hands of millions of new creators everywhere
Webmaker tools projects and events help educators youth mediamakers and everyday consumers around the world move from using the Web to making the Web In  Webmaker will mobilize a global community of mentors instructors and youth to teach and learn together advance revolutionary Webmaker software tools like Popcorn and Thimble and work together to build a more Webliterate planet
Webmaker Vide

Advocating for Web standards
Mozilla will continue to contribute to Web standards
Mozilla has always contributed to Web standards going back as far as the start of the project and we will continue to do that moving forward We cofounded the WHATWG to kick off HTML We are a leader in JavaScript standardization We have some of the top CSS and layout experts in the world
Standards are a multivendor effort but Mozilla is proud of the many technologies we have pioneered and submitted to standards bodies to make them interoperable for the Web as a whole Some examples of these include geolocation WebGL the Gamepad API Web Telephony and IndexedDB
Fighting for you Standing up for your security privacy and freedom
Mozilla is proudly nonprofit and answers to no one but you That means we're uniquely able to fight for users at a critical moment in the Web's history Looking forward we will mobilize millions of people to stand up for privacy security and online freedom We will take on new threats to the Web's future  from locked down proprietary platforms to wouldbe censors and gatekeepers to shortsighted government legislation Together we will set the mobile Web free reassert the vital importance of privacy and user sovereignty and join others in building a more Webliterate world
Our Internet experiences involve more of our personal data which forms a picture or profile of who we are online The ability for organizations to monitor log store use correlate and sell information about who we are and what we do has huge implications for individuals and for society
In an effort to give users more control over their Web experiences we developed the Do Not Track feature in Firefox We also became the first browser manufacturer to offer it on multiple platforms including Windows Mac Linux and Android Do Not Track is even available for Firefox OS so that user privacy settings can be controlled on a systemwide level to ensure that every thirdparty application on a user's device respects their choice
Do Not Track is important because it gives users a voice online to express their preference for privacy and personalization It captures the user’s intent and allows them to put their hand up and ask for privacy online
Mozilla was instrumental in the movement to motivate the Web community to act against the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP act These laws had they gone into effect would have given the US government and private businesses incredible censorship powers that would have global ramifications weaken the Internet's security and discourage innovation and investment worldwide
Mozilla was one of many organizations that blacked out its websites in opposition to the SOPAPIPA bills in congress For the first time the Web community of more than  million people came together to speak against a policy that affected the Web as a whole This historic protest represented a significant turning point for the Web as a way to engage the electorate and mobilize citizens for change
Early in  Mozilla warned against the ratification of the AntiCounterfeiting Trade Agreement ACTA by the European Parliament In a blog post Mitchell Baker urged the policymakers that opaque processes were a bad way to develop Internet policy  in particular that the global trade agreement was negotiated in private without open involvement of all the stakeholders After massive street protests of Netsavvy citizens across Europe the European Parliament rejected ACTA on July th in an unequivocal vote
Collusion
Mozilla Collusion gives consumers a powerful tool to protect their privacy arming them with transparency facts and the power to make their own decisions about how their personal data is shared and used Made possible with the support of the Ford Foundation Collusion allows users to see who is tracking them across the Web It shows in real time how that data creates a spiderweb of interaction between companies and other trackers
Firefox Flicks
This year we brought back Firefox Flicks  a video challenge for aspiring filmmakers animators and creatives from around the world to produce and submit short films These films made by Firefox fans promoted and educated users about the issues that affect their online lives such as privacy and security Most importantly these filmmakers shared what makes Firefox different using their own voices Celebrities and filmindustry experts helped select the regional winners from more than  submissions from thousands of filmmakers worldwide
Our success begins with you
Mozilla is an organization that is fundamentally about people and making the Web better for everyone The Mozilla community is essential to the success of the project We can’t fight for an open hackable and transparent Web without people who believe in and support that cause We have Mozilla communities spanning the world and these remarkable people are responsible for coding testing localizing hosting hackfests and summer code parties teaching Webmakers marketing evangelizing Mozilla products and much more
Mozilla Reps
The Mozilla Reps program designed to empower volunteers to become official representatives of Mozilla in their region has grown to more than  people in more than  countries in a little more than a year The program plays a critical role in helping Mozilla execute against its organizational goals around the promotion and development of Firefox OS Firefox for Windows Mac and Linux and Firefox for Android Reps have organized more than  events around the world and have successfully recruited and trained hundreds of new contributors across dozens of functional areas
MozCamps
MozCamps are regional events that bring together core paid and volunteer Mozilla staff members from all areas of the project for two full days of presentations discussions brainstorms work sprints hackathons and of course a little bit of fun
While the main focus is on community leaders and core contributors MozCamps also aim to train up future leaders  those Mozilla contributors who have been particularly active in the past six months and represent the next generation of Mozilla leadership in the community
This year‘s MozCamps were held in Buenos Aires Warsaw and Singapore bringing together more than  employees and  volunteers
Emerging Communities
Some of the fastest growing and most dynamic communities are some of our youngest communities They can be found in the Middle East Africa and South East Asia and many of their members have been invited to MozCamps in  as participants The Tunisian community Kenyan community and Filipino community have been doing particularly outstanding work and each comprises roughly a dozen active contributors across many functional areas including localization QA marketing and development One of the newest Mozilla communities launched in  is in Myanmar
Contributor Stories

Sustainability and Partnerships
Along with this annual report we released our audited financial statements for  Mozilla remains well positioned both financially and organizationally to advance our mission of building openness freedom and participation into the Internet
Mozilla remains financially healthy we continue to hire more people globally we’ve opened new Mozilla Spaces around the world have launched significant new initiatives such as Firefox OS and are able to support those with viable resources
The majority of our revenue comes from the search functionality in the Firefox browser Google is the largest source of revenue and in December  we announced that we negotiated a significant and mutually beneficial revenue agreement with Google This new agreement extends our long term search relationship with Google for at least three additional years
Mozilla has a number of other relationships in the Web community as well as new relationships with mobile operators device manufacturers thirdparty content partners and other players in the mobile ecosystem

At Mozilla we measure success by how much we are doing to improve the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers We succeed when we build products that people love and when other organizations build the traits and features we care about into competing products For example we view Google Chrome's recent implementation of the Do Not Track feature we pioneered to be a success for Mozilla and our mission
Mozilla has announced a commercial partnership with Telefónica for Firefox OS The specific terms of the agreement are subject to traditional confidentiality requirements We are developing new partnerships with additional OEMs and operators which will be announced in due course through  and into  We also have numerous arrangements with app publishers who will be included in the Firefox Marketplace
The State of Mozilla  Annual Report
SOPA  PIPA  ACTA
The State of Mozilla
What are the key projects for Mozilla in the next year How do you plan to influence the market going forward
The Firefox Web browser is and will continue to be a fundamental lever in driving the Web forward and advancing the Mozilla mission
Firefox OS is Mozilla’s mobile operating system based entirely on HTML Today  percent of  Billion people who go online do so primarily through a mobile device and that number is expected to grow With Firefox OS Mozilla has set out to develop and a completely open and standardsbased Web as a platform for innovation We've built the technologies and APIs to make the Web a rich and viable option and we are committed to driving forward the adoption of HTML as a platform for the mobile industry
With the Mozilla Webmaker program we are aiming to move millions of people from Web users to active Web creators who will build the next great Web experiences The goal is to create a more Web literate planet through tools and learning programs that fuel creativity on the Web
How do you measure success
At Mozilla we measure success by how much we are doing to improve the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers We succeed when we build products that people love and when other organizations build build the traits and features we care about into competing products For example we view Google Chrome's recent implementation of the Do Not Track feature we pioneered to be a success for Mozilla and our mission
Unlike our major competitors Mozilla achieves success by helping more people make choices about what software they want to use what level of participation they would like to have online and how to take part in building a better Internet When we see growth in community contributors software localizations and a competitive browser market for example we know we are moving toward our goals and we are seeing growth in these areas
What was Mozilla’s total revenue for 
Mozilla’s consolidated reported revenue Mozilla Foundation and all subsidiaries for  was M US up approximately  percent from M in 
How does Mozilla generate revenue
The majority of Mozilla’s revenue is generated from search and commerce functionality included in our Firefox product through all major search partners including Google Bing Yahoo Yandex Amazon Ebay and others Mozilla’s reported revenues also include very important individual and corporate donations and grants which are growing significantly as well as other forms of income from our investable assets
Are you exploring partnership opportunities to diversify your revenue stream
We currently have several key business partnerships and are actively exploring new partnership opportunities as well as other potential revenue opportunities We’ll continue to build great products that help people enjoy the richness of the Internet and we’re confident that this allows us to identify appropriate sources of revenue that serve both the mission and our users
Some key Mozilla Foundation projects like Collusion have received grants from organizations such as the Ford Foundation
What is the status of the organization’s search partnerships
We currently have partnerships with a number of search providers that differ by market In December  we announced a new agreement with Google as the default search provider in Firefox This new agreement extends our longterm search relationship with Google for at least three additional years The specific terms of this commercial agreement are subject to traditional confidentiality requirements and we’re not at liberty to disclose them
What is the status of your commercial relationship with Bing
Bing is included as a search provider in the US versions of Firefox The arrangement includes revenuesharing based on traffic sent from Firefox to Bing's search service
What happened with Yandex Is there anything you can update us on with that partnership
Google is the default search provider on the Russian builds of Firefox Yandex will remain in the preinstalled list of search plugins The change is part of the global search renewal that Mozilla entered into with Google which makes Google the search default
Mozilla and Yandex will continue to explore partnerships on a number of fronts including the customized Yandex edition of the popular Firefox browser and the integration of Yandex search services in other regional builds
What sort of commercial agreements do you have in place in mobile
Mozilla has announced a commercial partnership with Telefonica for Firefox OS The specific terms of the agreement are subject to traditional confidentiality requirements We are developing new partnerships with additional OEMs and operators which will be announced in due course through  and into  We also have numerous arrangements with app publishers who will be included in Firefox Marketplace
How much revenue do you anticipate that will bring in the coming year and what is the business modelrevenue model in those deals
We are not providing forecasts or projections at this time Our main focus is on creating and delivering offerings that address user developer and operator needs At the same time we are continually exploring potential new revenue models that serve both the mission and our users
What makes you think you can break into the smartphone market with two clearly dominant players
Mozilla believes that the Web is the best platform for innovation connecting sharing and for building the world that we want With Firefox OS Mozilla is creating an operating system based entirely on open Web standards HTML is an increasingly important technology which more and more developers are embracing There is also an HTML ecosystem of developers who are already creating applications for desktop web browsers while many AppStore and Android applications have already been developed in HTML
How many operatorcarrier partners do you have signed up for Firefox OS
The first Firefox OSpowered devices are expected to launch commercially in Latin American markets in early  through Telefónica We've also announced support for the Firefox OS from global network operators including Deutsche Telekom Etisalat Smart Sprint Telecom Italia and Telenor so you can expect more device and OS news throughout 
What OEM will you be working with
TCL Communication Technology who own the Alcatel brand and ZTE are leading partners to build the first handsets to run Firefox OS We expect to announce additional OEM support soon
When can we expect to see devices launching in the United States Europe
The first Open Web Devices will be launched in Latin American markets in early  Other locations have yet to be announced
What is the business model for your app marketplace
Firefox Marketplace will offer developers’ discovery distribution and monetization opportunities and will also be customizable by partners For example with Telefónica we will provide directtobill capabilities in the device in the event that app store owners would like to bill Telefónica customers directly But app developers are free to use their own billing systems You can read about this in the Telefónica Marketplace Payments Guide for further details of how payments will work
What are your projections for growth in  in desktop mobile OS
We are not providing forecasts or projections at this time
What are the key projects for Mozilla in the next year
Our flagship product the Firefox Web browser is and will continue to be a fundamental lever in driving the Web forward and advancing the Mozilla mission Firefox for Android is our popular mobile browser which currently enjoys a star average rating in Google Play
Firefox OS is the first truly open operating system for mobile devices delivering the same security privacy customization and user control that people have come to expect from the Firefox browser Mozilla has built the technologies and APIs to make the Web a rich and viable platform for the mobile industry With the support of valued partners from across the mobile ecosystem Firefox OS phones are now on sale in  markets globally as of midNovember  and Mozilla will continue to advance its development and adoption
With the Mozilla Webmaker program we are aiming to move millions of people from Web users to active Web creators who will build the next great experiences The goal is to create a more Webliterate planet through tools and learning programs that fuel creativity for people of all ages
At Mozilla we measure success by how much we improve the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers We succeed when we build products that people love and when other organizations adopt the traits and features we care about into competing products
Unlike our major competitors Mozilla achieves success by helping more people make choices about what software they want to use what level of participation they would like to have online and how to take part in building a better Internet When we see growth in community contributors software localizations and a competitive browser market for example we know we are moving toward our goals

We currently have several key business partnerships and are actively exploring new ones as well as other potential revenue opportunities We’ll continue to build great products that help people enjoy the richness of the Internet and we’re confident that this allows us to identify appropriate sources of revenue that serve both the mission and our users
Some key Mozilla Foundation projects like Lightbeam have received grants from organizations such as the Ford Foundation
Revenues from Google have increased significantly since  What changed with that relationship
Our search partnerships are designed as multiyear contracts Near the end of each contract Mozilla negotiates marketvalue rates from multiple search providers based on the present and future value our products provide At the end of  Mozilla negotiated a new agreement with Google based on growth and impact from our Firefox desktop browser
How does Mozilla spend its money
Mozilla invests in both people and products to further our mission to keep the Web open and to retain our impact on the Internet landscape We continue to spend a significant majority of our expenses on staffing our technology and development and recently have increased our spending in marketing new product lines Over the last few years Mozilla’s investment focus has been significant in new areas such as our mobile and cloud services products In particular the market launch of Firefox OS and significant upgrades to our Firefox for Android browser have advanced our goal of opening the mobile ecosystem for users and developers worldwide
Mozilla’s tax returns and financial documents from previous years are all available on this site
We currently have partnerships with a number of search providers that differ by market In December  we announced a new agreement with Google as the default search provider in Firefox which extends at least three years The specific terms of this commercial agreement are subject to traditional confidentiality requirements and we’re not at liberty to disclose them
How does Mozilla make money with Firefox OS
The first Firefox OS devices went on sale in July  so are in the very early stages of market development and user acquisition Mozilla’s focus is on delivering a superior user experience and getting developers excited and not on generating revenue from Firefox OS at this time
There is very high demand in emerging markets for smartphone technology at a reasonable price without longterm contractual carrier subsidies By using Web technology Firefox OS and its apps are one layer closer to the hardware so less memory and CPU is needed to get high performance The result is a full Web experience that’s attainable for many feature phone users enabling people to purchase their first smartphone
Firefox OS  launched in  markets and growing  taps into the largest digital ecosystem there is the Web We believe the Web is the best platform for innovation connecting sharing and for building the world that we want
How many operator partners does Mozilla have for Firefox OS
Mozilla has announced support for Firefox OS from  major operators that span the globe América Móvil China Unicom Deutsche Telekom Etisalat Hutchison Three Group KDDI KT MegaFon Qtel SingTel Smart Sprint Telecom Italia Group Telefónica Telenor Telstra TMN and VimpelCom As of midNovember  Firefox OS smartphones are on sale commercially through Telefónica and Deutsche Telekom in  Latin American and European markets
Which manufacturers are making Firefox OS devices
As of midNovember  there are three different Firefox OS phones on sale the ZTE Open the ALCATEL ONE TOUCH Fire and the LG Fireweb Huawei has also committed to manufacturing Firefox OS smartphones and Foxconn announced in June  that it plans to build a range of Firefox OS devices We expect to announce additional OEM support soon
When can we expect to see devices launching in the United States
Market launch timing for a Firefox OS phone targeted to US consumers is dependent on our operator and manufacturer partners and we are actively exploring that opportunity but don't have specific plans to announce at this time
Mozilla has become more active in policy matters Are you lobbying now
Mozilla is not a lobbying operation Notwithstanding we take firm stands when the welfare of the Web and its users are at stake
On issues such as SOPAPIPA CISPA and more recently government surveillance revelations Mozilla has voiced its views sought to educate users and taken steps to catalyze grassroots action As with most issues of importance we believe education listening and dialogue amongst stakeholders are critical to finding solutions Mozilla has testified before government bodies and provided input to numerous agencies and NGOs on strengthening the Internet Our acclaimed Firefox Addon Lightbeam seeks to educate users on matters of privacy in their online lives
Mozilla’s efforts have resulted in being named the Most Trusted Internet Company for Privacy in  according to a study performed by the Ponemon Institute
State of Mozilla
We are champions of a Web where people know more do more and do better
A Web For All
As the Web expands to reach billions of new people and touch our lives in new ways it has become an essential part of our individual growth and collective future And that Web is what the Mozilla community has pledged to protect and promote a platform providing opportunity connectivity and inspiration for all
We live our principles by making products empowering communities teaching skills and shaping environments in order to build the Internet the world needs
At this year’s Mozilla Summit  people representing  countries and  languages gathered to develop a shared understanding of who we are and what we will accomplish together Below is a sample of perspectives from leaders of the project

Mozilla’s Key Internet Issues
Shaping the Agenda
Mozilla has identified five issues that we believe must be tackled in the current era to build the open internet we want
Online Privacy  Security
People understand and can meaningfully control how their data is collected and used online and trust that it’s safe In parallel companies and governments work to protect our data and enhance our ownership over our digital identities
Open is the default open source and open standards continue to be at the heart of the Internet and influence organizations and industries products policies and practices As a result entrepreneurs and everyday Internet users can create innovate and compete online without asking permission
The technologies and platforms people use every day are interoperable and based on open standards People expect and demand systems that allow seamless flow and transfer of information and content
People have the skills to read write and participate in the digital world Together these informed digital citizens move beyond just consuming content to creating shaping and defending the web
People everywhere can access and have the opportunity to participate in building the entire Internet Subsequently everyone on the Internet has the opportunity to access and shape our digital world The Internet reflects the diversity of the people who use it
Mozilla and our allies will bring these issues frontandcenter by being an increasingly visible public voice weaving these issues throughout our leadership and advocacy work and building technologies that take a stance
The Mozilla Leadership Networ
Connecting Leaders
The Mozilla Leadership Network is a global network of diverse leaders  from the young activist teaching web literacy to her community to the executive leading a global organization  who will ensure the next wave of access inclusion and opportunity online
Leaders in this network will take action together to
Shape and spread the open internet agenda
Model ‘open’ values and practices in institutions products and policies around the world
How we wor
The Mozilla Leadership Network accomplishes its work through thematic ‘hubs’ communities of people with diverse expertise who are helping others build the capacity to advance the open Internet in their field or topic of interest
Our current hubs include
Learning Educators and librarians committed to transforming learning in our digital age
Science Researchers and data scientists committed to making research and practice more open
Internet Policy  Advocacy Individuals and organizations focused on advancing open Internet issues
Women  Web Literacy Community organizers and senior leaders creating opportunities for women and girls to develop web literacy skills
Internet of Things Hackers and designers creating provocative prototypes for what an open Internet of Things could and should be
Our Initiatives
The Mozilla Leadership Network pursues our goals through five key initiatives which are reflected in each hub
Curricula  Training We provide free and open curricula and training programs to help leaders develop the skills they need to ensure the next wave of access inclusion and opportunity online Example Web Literacy Training Module
Partnerships We initiate and grow partnerships that enable Mozilla our community and our allies to maximize their impact Example Gigabit Community Fund
Convening We bring members of the Mozilla Leadership Network together to learn from one another exchange ideas and join forces Example MozFest
Membership Members join because they share Mozilla’s vision and stay because of the strong diverse community and unique professional development opportunities the network provides Example Fellowships

Lightbeam for Firefox
Lightbeam is a Firefox addon that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web
Shine a Light on Who’s Watching You
See who’s tracking you online
As you browse Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today including parts that are not transparent to the average user
Download Lightbeam for Firefox
Get it from Mozilla AddOns
How Lightbeam Works
Download and run the Lightbeam addon in your Firefox browser
Lightbeam will create a record of events for every site you visit and every third party site that is stored locally on your browser
Lightbeam visually graphs these events to highlight the interactions between sites you intentionally visit and the third parties
Lightbeam will continue to add to your graph as you browse the Web You can stop Lightbeam at any time by disabling it or uninstalling the addon Your Lightbeam data can be easily saved or deleted
Tracking  privacy
Not all tracking is bad Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience
But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge
That’s not okay for some
It should be you who decides when how and if you want your browsing data to be shared We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users  both with tools and information
We’re building this crowdsourced directory to encourage users to visualize the state of tracking as an aggregate and to examine relationships that exist on the Web
Visualize your data
After you download and install the Lightbeam addon to Firefox it will begin to create a real time visualization of the websites you visit and all the third parties that are also active on those pages
Analyze your connections
As your visualizations grow you can take a closer look into the relationships between the various first and third party sites that are stored in your data You can also reset or save your data at any time
To help us you can contribute your data to our Lightbeam database
Supported by the Ford Foundation
The work at the Ford Foundation focuses on building outreach campaigns to help people understand online data tracking  both the benefits and the issues
About Lightbeam
Lightbeam visualizes the relationships between the sites you visit and the third party sites that are active on those pages
How the addon works
Using two distinct interactive graphic representations  Graph and List  Lightbeam enables you to examine individual third parties identify where they connect to your online activity and provides ways for you to engage with this unique view of the Web
Using three distinct interactive graphic representations  Graph Clock and List  Lightbeam enables you to examine individual third parties over time and space identify where they connect to your online activity and provides ways for you to engage with this unique view of the Web
The default Graph view provides a real time visualization of every site you visit and all third party requests made from your browser
The Graph view also provides adjustable filters that allow you to visualize more types of data at a glance
The List view provides more options for drilling down into individual sites
Site preferences in the List view enable you to block sites from connecting to your Firefox browser watch sites you’re interested in or hide sites you don’t want to see visualized
Lightbeam also offers an information panel that provides additional details about the site you selected and the sites it has connected to
The origins of Lightbeam
Lightbeam began in July  as Collusion a personal project by Mozilla software developer Atul Varma
Inspired by the book The Filter Bubble Atul created an experimental addon to visualize browsing behavior and data collection on the Web
In February  Gary Kovacs Mozilla CEO at the time introduced the Collusion addon in a TED talk now one of the most watched TED talks of all time about exposing online tracking
In September  Mozilla joined forces with faculty and student researchers at Emily Carr University of Art  Design to develop and implement visualizations for the addon
With the support of the Ford Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council NSERC Collusion has been reimagined as Lightbeam and was launched in the fall of

Policy and the larger tracking narrative
At Mozilla we believe that everyone should have the tools to make their own decisions about their online privacy and who collects data on them
With the Lightbeam addon we are providing a valuable and open community research platform that aims to raise awareness promote analysis and ultimately affect policy change in the areas of tracking and privacy
Lightbeam is one step in a larger concerted effort by Mozilla and its partners to provide Web users with greater control and transparency of their personal data

Community Participation Guidelines
Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines
Version   Updated May  
The heart of Mozilla is people We put people first and do our best to recognize appreciate and respect the diversity of our global contributors The Mozilla Project welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community As such we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Participation Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all
These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate introduce new ideas and inspire others regardless of
Background
Family status
Gender
Gender identity or expression
Marital status
Sex
Sexual orientation
Native language
Age
Ability
Race andor ethnicity
National origin
Socioeconomic status
Religion
Geographic location
Any other dimension of diversity
Openness collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work  from development on Firefox to collaboratively designing curriculum We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior
When and How to Use These Guidelines
These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as members of the Mozilla community in all Mozilla activities both offline and online Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all Mozilla activities including but not limited to
Working in Mozilla spaces
Working with other Mozillians and other Mozilla community participants virtually or colocated
Representing Mozilla at public events
Representing Mozilla in social media official accounts staff accounts personal accounts Facebook pages
Participating in Mozilla offsites and trainings
Participating in Mozillarelated forums mailing lists wikis websites chat channels bugs group or persontoperson meetings and Mozillarelated correspondence
These guidelines work in conjunction with our AntiHarassmentDiscrimination Policies which sets out protections for and obligations of Mozilla employees The AntiHarassmentDiscrimination Policy is crafted with specific legal definitions and requirements in mind
If you experience behavior outside of Mozilla communities in person or online that makes participation in Mozilla not a safe and positive community experience for all please contact us at inclusion@mozillacom While these guidelines  code of conduct are specifically aimed at Mozilla’s work and community we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of Mozilla’s online or inperson spaces to have a deep impact on community health For example in the past we publicly identified an anonymous posting aimed at a Mozilla employee in a nonMozilla forum as clear grounds for removal from the Mozilla community This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm We anticipate wideranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries
Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected of all Mozillians
Be Respectful
Value each other’s ideas styles and viewpoints We may not always agree but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong Be kind in all interactions and communications especially when debating the merits of different options Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people Be direct constructive and positive Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes  if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions listen carefully apologize sincerely and correct the behavior going forward
Be Direct but Professional
We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve We cannot withhold hard truths Doing so respectfully is hard doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still We need to be honest and direct as well as respectful
Be Inclusive
Seek diverse perspectives Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation even if it is not always comfortable Encourage all voices Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively If you find yourself dominating a discussion it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible
Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are
Remote on video or phone
Not native language speakers
Coming from a different culture
Using pronouns other than he or she
Living in a different time zone
Facing other challenges to participate
Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate If you find yourself dominating a discussion step back Make way for other voices and listen actively to them
Understand Different Perspectives
Our goal should not be to win every disagreement or argument A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking Winning is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger
Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences
Mozillians come from many cultures and backgrounds Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing Be respectful of people with different cultural practices attitudes and beliefs Work to eliminate your own biases prejudices and discriminatory practices Think of others’ needs from their point of view Use preferred titles including pronouns and the appropriate tone of voice Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself it is unrealistic to expect Mozillians to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions
Lead by Example
By matching your actions with your words you become a person others want to follow Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes Design your community and your work for inclusion Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors Make decisions based on the highest good for Mozilla’s mission

History of the Mozilla Project
The Mozilla project was created in  with the release of the Netscape browser suite source code
It was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market
Within the first year new community members from around the world had already contributed new functionality enhanced existing features and became engaged in the management and planning of the project itself
By creating an open community the Mozilla project had become larger than any one company
Community members got involved and expanded the scope of the project’s original mission  instead of just working on Netscape’s next browser people started creating a variety of browsers development tools and a range of other projects
People contributed to Mozilla in different ways but everyone was passionate about creating free software that would enable people to have a choice in how they experienced the Internet
After several years of development Mozilla  the first major version was released in  This version featured many improvements to the browser email client and other applications included in the suite but not many people were using it
By  well over  of Internet users were browsing with Internet Explorer
Not many people noticed at the time but the first version of Phoenix later renamed to Firefox was also released by Mozilla community members that year with the goal of providing the best possible browsing experience to the widest possible set of people
In  the Mozilla project created the Mozilla Foundation an independent nonprofit organization supported by individual donors and a variety of companies
The new Mozilla Foundation continued the role of managing the daily operations of the project and also officially took on the role of promoting openness innovation and opportunity on the Internet
It did this by continuing to release software such as Firefox and Thunderbird and expanding to new areas such as providing grants to support accessibility improvements on the Web
Firefox  was released in  and became a big success  in less than a year it was downloaded over  million times
New versions of Firefox have come out regularly since then and keep setting new records The popularity of Firefox has helped bring choice back to users
The renewed competition has accelerated innovation and improved the Internet for everyone
In  we launched Firefox OS to unleash the full power of the Web on smartphones and once again offer control and choice to a new generation of people coming online
Mozilla also celebrated its th anniversary in 
The community has shown that commercial companies can benefit by collaborating in open source projects and that great end user products can be produced as open source software
More people than ever before are using the Internet and are experiencing it in their own language
A sustainable organization has been created that uses market mechanisms to support a public benefit mission and this model has been reused by others to create open transparent and collaborative organizations in a broad range of areas
The future is full of challenges and opportunities equal to those of our past
There’s no guarantee that the Internet will remain open or enjoyable or safe
Mozilla will continue to provide an opportunity for people to make their voices heard and to shape their own online lives
Of course we’re not alone in doing this
The Mozilla community together with other open source projects and other public benefit organizations exists only because of the people who are engaged in making our common goals a reality

Our history
Our mission
Introduction
The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives
The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness innovation and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet We have worked together since  to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser
The Mozilla project uses a communitybased approach to create worldclass open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us
As a result of these efforts we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life We set out these principles below
The goals for the Manifesto are to
articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue
speak to people whether or not they have a technical background
make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue and
provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet
These principles will not come to life on their own People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory  people acting as individuals working together in groups and leading others The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone
Principles
Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet
Advancing the Mozilla Manifest
There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto We welcome a broad range of activities and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto
Mozilla Foundation Pledge
The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its activities Specifically we will
build and enable opensource technologies and communities that support the Manifesto’s principles
build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto’s principles
use the Mozilla assets intellectual property such as copyrights and trademarks infrastructure funds and reputation to keep the Internet an open platform
promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit and
promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and within the Internet industry
Some Foundation activitiescurrently the creation delivery and promotion of consumer productsare conducted primarily through the Mozilla Foundation’s wholly owned subsidiary the Mozilla Corporation
Invitation
The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us and to find new ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality

Decentralization Vital to Internet Health
A decentralized internet owned by all of us is where net neutrality interoperability competition and local contribution thrive
A healthy Internet is created and owned by us all
The Internet owes much of its success to openness its open shared structure has made it easy for everyone to build surf and thrive on it But a few big companies are closing in closing doors and creating walled gardens that concentrate their ownership and control of the Web Together we can fight to make sure no one limits our Internet access experience or creation
A healthy Internet belongs to you
Here are four areas where we can make a difference
Net Neutrality
Interoperability
Competition and Choice
Local Contribution
Decentralization means Net Neutrality
No one should be able to restrict our access to the Web for their own gain
We rely on network providers  telcos and cable companies  for access to the Internet Which puts them in a position to restrict that access for their own business objectives favoring their own products blocking sites or brands or charging different prices and offering different speeds depending on content type Net neutrality prohibits network providers from discriminating based on content so everyone has equal access
As of December   countries currently have laws in place to protect Net Neutrality

Building community

Decentralization means Interoperability
The Web should remain open and interoperable so we can keep our experience consistent transparent and full of possibility
Interoperability is a big word with a simple result your Web experience is basically the same across browsers hardware and operating systems because it was designed that way  and built with the open standards to support it Open standards also allow anyone to invent new ways to make your Web experience better But interoperability is losing ground to closed systems  and we’re losing transparency participation and innovation along with it

How you can support interoperability

Decentralization means Competition and Choice
The Internet should continue to foster healthy competition among companies opportunity for entrepreneurs and meaningful choices for users
A personalized Internet is an exciting prospect But more and more that means opting into a single company’s ecosystem  which streamlines your experience right now but may seriously limit your choices in the future Competitors will be reduced to those few companies who can offer the whole enchilada thus consolidating the power of existing tech giants and making it much harder for entrepreneurs to disrupt the market with great ideas

Decentralization means Local Contribution
We should all be able to contribute to the Web so it reflects and serves all of its users
Today  billion people all over the world use the Internet to learn work play and connect But not everyone is able to contribute to it equally Which means the Web doesn’t reflect the full diversity of its users doesn’t work as well for some people as others and can even marginalize certain communities and individuals

Digital Inclusion Vital to Internet Health
Digital inclusion means promoting diversity practicing respect and supporting universal access online
A Healthy Internet is Inclusive to All
The more voices perspective languages and people contributing to the Web the richer the experience for everyone But the whole Internet is not yet accessible welcoming and safe for all Together we have the power to shape the Web and our world along with it
A healthy Internet is open to you
Here are three areas where we can make a difference
Promote Diversity
Practice Respect
Support Universal Access
Digital Inclusion means promoting diversity
For the Internet to fulfill its greatest promise it must reflect the diversity and experience of all people everywhere
As inclusive as the Web can seem it’s not yet an equal playing field More than half the world is still without it emerging economies and marginalized communities are often the last to gain access Far fewer women are using the Internet than men And without diversity among its creators the Web itself will reflect unconscious biases while personalizing algorithms can reinforce our own
In nine developing countries women are still nearly  less likely to access the Internet than men
Source World Wide Web Foundation 
How you can promote diversity
Create web content
Create your own Web content  like videos blog posts GIFs  in your language local to your area
Build resources
Support a resource like Wikipedia that drastically lowers the barriers to knowledge  or better yet help build it Wikipedia needs more and more diverse contributors
How Mozilla is promoting diversity
Advancing accessibility
Advancing web accessibility standards and making Firefox inclusive through efforts like our Accessibility team
Building digital skills
Partnering with UN Women to help women in Africa and across the globe build key digital skills
Digital Inclusion means practicing respect
We should all have the ability to participate fully on the Internet without threat to our reputations our confidence or our safety
We’ve all seen our share of nasty comments sections At times the Web can feel like a very unfriendly place  particularly for women minorities and members of marginalized communities By discouraging people from getting online cyberbullying and cyber violence threaten not just individuals but the Internet itself
How you can practice respect
Report bullying
If you see cyber violence and bullying online record it and report it
Talk about respect
Talk to your kids about cyberbullying and encourage their teachers to do the same
How Mozilla is practicing respect
Supporting tools for safety
Supporting the Coral Project which works to improve how journalists and communities engage on news websites including tools like Talk that aims to create smarter safer comments sections
Empowering individuals
Creating open curricula that empowers people to create safe spaces online like the Teaching Kit Combating Cyber Violence Against Women and Girls
Digital Inclusion means supporting universal access to the whole Internet
We should all have affordable highquality unrestricted access to the whole Web so the whole world can benefit
To participate online you have to be able to get online Programs have emerged that offer free or subsidized Internet access but it is often slow or restricted creating a ‘poor Internet for poor people’ At its most extreme governments worldwide are turning off all or parts of the Internet to serve their own agendas which can threaten human rights and even the health of the global economy
In  there were  intentional Internet shutdowns in  countries

A healthy Internet is open for innovation

Patents Building a system that encourages innovation
Our patent system should work with and for open innovation not against it
Patents were designed to create incentive for innovation But the patent system and software development don’t always get along so well Software patents are often written so broadly that they’re open to misinterpretation and exclusive rights can far outlive the shelf life of the software itself All of which creates obstacles and uncertainty for innovators and leaves the door open for patent trolls and endless litigation
High Tech patents are the subject of more disputes than all other patents combined

Cyber Security Locking down your sensitive information
We should all have the ability to protect our online identity

Making Web literacy meaningful for everyone
Web literacy should mean all the skills we need to think create and thrive online
Many people hear the term Web literacy and think it means learning to code or STEM science technology engineering math education But Web literacy is much broader than that  it should include all the skills to be confident and competent online To be empowered digital citizens we all need to know how to navigate how to share what information to trust and most importantly how to expand the frontiers of our knowledge

Advocating for education policy
Working with educations and policymakers to help make Web literacy as foundational to education as reading and math
Teaching Web literacy effectively
Web literacy should be as foundational to education as reading writing and math  and it should be taught everywhere learning happens
Learning Web literacy is like any other essential skill we learn best by doing And in the digital world learning happens not just with teachers in the classroom but everywhere there’s an Internet connection We need all kinds of educators to have the knowledge and resources to teach Web literacy the way kids learn it best And we need to make sure every student grows up not just on the Web but fluent in the way it works

Cybersecurity
Ask yourself
Do you check for a secure connection when browsing the Web Do you know how to recognize one
Are you doing as much to secure your online information as you do your personal property
How many passwords do you use and how long have you had them
Cybersecurity explained
As intimidating as it may sound cybersecurity is actually really simple it just means protecting yourself and your information online
You can’t prevent every threat out there  online or off
But you can definitely minimize your risk with some awareness and common sense

CIGI IPSOS November 
Protecting yourself starts with knowing what to look out for Here’s a quick rundown of the three most common cybersecurity threats
Manipulation
Malicious hackers use all kinds of tricks to access and exploit your personal information
Like phishing eg a fake bank email asking for your personal information spamming hacked accounts and the classic Nigerian Prince email also called a  scam
Healthy skepticism is your best friend on this front
Test your phishing knowledge
Malware
Viruses worms Trojan horses These nasty little programs are designed to infect your machine to cause damage steal personal information spy or force ads on you
Avoiding malware means being smart about where you click
Network and Computer Attacks
Websites and networks are vulnerable to attacks from the simple to the very sophisticated
This threat is the hardest to prevent But you can put a few more barriers between yourself and the attackers
Build your safety net
Improve your security online with these safety measures recommended by Mozilla policy pros
Look both ways
The first and most important thing is just to pay close attention to where and when you click
Trust your gut
If a link or download doesn’t feel quite right it probably isn’t
Make sure you install programs only from verified trusted sources and don’t click on anything that looks even remotely suspicious  even when you think you know the source
Watch yourself in public
When you navigate the Web on a public WiFi network anyone who chooses to snoop can see some or all of your activity
So avoid sensitive activities when surfing in public
And before you share any kind of info anywhere online think about how it might make you vulnerable
Lock your doors
Strong password practices are your single best protection against almost every kind of threat on the Web
Choose strong PINs and passwords
Here are some Mozilla tips for creating a strong password for every device and account
And get in the habit of changing your passwords once a year
Don’t use a single password everywhere
Would you use the same key for your front door your car and your safety deposit box Probably not
Keep track with a password manager instead
Do the twostep
For the best protection take advantage of step authentication wherever it’s offered

In case of emergency
Here’s what to do if you think your account has been compromised
Fix it before it breaks
Software updates are like oil changes  they can be a hassle in the moment but a lifesaver in hindsight

Get smart on government surveillance
Decide where you think the line should be  and keep others from crossing it Get smart on government surveillance
If you’re not under investigation should the government be able to
monitor your phone calls
read your emails and view the photos I send
see what you search for on the Web
Government surveillance explained
Stakeouts have always been an essential tool for law enforcement and national security
The difference now is that they’ve moved beyond binoculars bugs and bad guys surveillance has gone digital
All that data we generate through our daily activities online allows governments to keep an eye on lots of people at once in hopes of catching the ones who are up to no good
It’s like grabbing a giant haystack just in case there might be a needle inside
Stored info is vulnerable inf
In order to tailor personal experiences for you virtually every technology company you interact with collects and stores some amount of your personal information
Under certain circumstances those companies can be forced to turn over your information to governments
So what should companies do
They can be proactive about protecting users’ information by limiting data collection to what’s needed making data anonymous where possible and deleting data when it’s no longer necessary
This is what we practice at Mozilla
The solution Safeguards
When surveillance is too broad or lacks key safeguards  like getting a warrant from a judge  it can be abused either accidentally or on purpose And our personal privacy is what’s at stake
In order to protect our personal liberties and maintain our trust in the Internet Mozilla’s policy team proposes that government surveillance must follow three fundamental principles
Minimal impact
Efforts should be made to collect only the information that’s needed without compromising Internet infrastructure technology companies’ data systems or users’ trust
Accountability
Governments should be held accountable
This means being transparent and specific about information collection and answering to independent oversight and to the public
User security
Strong encryption and security keep us safe from many kinds of criminals
Governments shouldn’t weaken the security of all in the name of spying on a few
Some amount of surveillance for law enforcement and intelligence properly designed is valuable to keep us safe But when it’s too broad it violates the privacy rights of millions of innocent people and can even undermine our security
 Chris Riley Head of Public Policy Mozilla
of Internet users are concerned with the police or other government agencies from their country secretly monitoring their online activities
Act before you react
We all have the right to live a full online life without fear of surveillance Rather than give up your freedom take back your control
The first thing we can all do is keep our eyes and ears out  and make our voices heard
Start with a simple online search to learn about your government’s stance on surveillance so you can make informed decisions about your privacy

We actively track issues of mass surveillance and other threats to the Web so we’ll let you know about opportunities to speak out
Close your blinds
These quick steps can help protect you from overreaching surveillance practices
Browse carefully
Always look for the padlock in your browser’s address bar
Cap your camera
Put a sticker in front of your webcam when you’re not using it
Watch the WiFi
Be careful when using a public WiFi network
Change your locks
Passwords are an essential tool for shielding information from prying eyes
See instructions for Firefox Chrome Internet Explorer Safari and Opera
Try encryption
Encryption is a bit like scrambling a frequency it turns information into codes that can only be read if you have the right keys
No software provides perfect protection from spying but Mozilla programmers recommend these easy encryption tools to take your online security beyond basic
Phone apps
These apps use encryption to secure your phone calls texts picture and video communications
Device encryption
Use these on your devices to make sure the only eyes that see your personal information are the ones you authorize

Use BitLocker Windows Pro or a free program called Diskcryptor standard Windows versions

Blast your surveillance smarts
Now that you have tools to help protect yourself spread the word to friends
The only way we’ll get a handle on this fundamental issue of technology is if we keep the conversation going
Which would you be more comfortable sharing with the government your checking account number or your DNA profile
If you had a digital lockbox that no one could see but you what would you put in it
Have you stopped sharing certain things online since you found out about mass government surveillance
Are you a teacher Give your students a simple lesson on government surveillance
Get smart on tracking
What you do online is your business and you can keep it that way Get smart on tracking
Do you feel in control of your personal information online
Do you know what a cookie is no not the delicious kind
Have you ever wondered why some content like ads seems to follow you around
What is tracking
Every time we go online we leave behind traces of our activity They’re often called our digital footprints and for good reason because tracking is sort of like retracing our steps
But our digital footprints reveal more about us than where we’ve been  everything from our preferences to our identities

To get a good look at how tracking works be sure to check out the first episode of Brett Gaylor’s documentary series Do Not Track
Tracking in action
Let’s imagine a typical day online you start by checking emails maybe share a fun article you just read
At lunch you check showtimes for a movie a friend recommended on Facebook and look up prices for some new camping gear you’ve had your eye on
That’s only a few sites but what’s happening behind the scenes is that many more thirdparties  companies that are separate from the sites you’re visiting  are seeing and recording your activity
So when you begin seeing recommended articles about that movie or ads for that camping gear later in the day it’s no coincidence
Tracking for personalization
What are cookies
Cookies are small data files that websites and third parties place on your computer to remember your preferences or to track your activity sometimes across multiple sites
of adults say they are not too confident or not at all confident that records of their activity maintained by the online advertisers who place ads on the websites they visit will remain private and secure
Pew Research Center May 
The websites we visit will often collect data about us to better personalize our experiences with them
The information they gather through analytics can be used to make navigating their site easier for us or to present us more relevant offers
They also use cookies  small data files placed in our browsers  to remember language preferences or the contents in a shopping cart
By the way
Mozilla sites are no exception Like most other Web sites we also use third party tools to improve user experience
For more info see our Website Privacy Notice
Tracking without permission
Many websites we visit contain hidden third parties  such as data brokers affiliate networks and advertising networks  who use cookies and other data tracking methods to collect information about our browsing habits without our consent
While tracking can be helpful there can’t be a healthy tradeoff between the value it provides and the data it collects without transparency
Going beyond the Web
Online tracking is just one part of a larger ecosystem of data collection
Within this ecosystem anonymized online data can be merged with personally identifiable information about you information that you may have volunteered on a form in an app or that was collected offline to build a surprisingly detailed profile of you
These profiles have the potential to interfere with your life offline and can contribute to unfair practices by being improperly used for price discrimination decreased creditworthiness more expensive insurance coverage or unfavorable employment or health reports
While these instances are not widespread yet they do illustrate the potential depths of what is happening behind the scenes and outside of our control
Be the boss of your personal inf
There are many ways you can take back and maintain control of your online activity
Here are some important tips handpicked by Mozilla experts
Think deeper
A lot goes on behind the scenes of the Internet The more you know the better you can decide what your information is worth to you
Understand the hidden cost of free
We all like the appeal of free apps and online services but if you’re not paying for them someone is and what they’re buying may be the data you leave behind
Decide whether the information you share is worth the service you are receiving
Shine a light on trackers
If you’re a Firefox user be sure to check out Lightbeam a simple and insightful addon that visually graphs the depth of your browsing activity including parts that are not usually visible to you
Think before you clic
When you see an element on a page such as a like or social media login button that’s an indication that some information has already been collected about you  clicking on it will share even more
Choose choice
It’s easy to overlook the access to personal data that we might offer through online accounts and apps but most offer settings that give you choice and control
Delete your unused accounts
Your data might get sold when a service or app shuts down
If you don’t use it close it
Protect your profiles
Some services you interact directly with let you control the information they have about you
Look at any opportunity to change or control your profile if offered
For example you can manage your profile and preferences for Google Yahoo and Facebook ads and even edit data that’s been collected about you by Acxiom one of the world’s largest marketing data brokers
Don’t forget about apps
Some mobile apps you install can access a lot of information about you including details not necessarily related to the service they provide
Control your privacy and location settings on iOS and Android
Look to your browser
Most Web browsers offer a set of privacy features designed to give you control
Here are a few key ones that you can make use of
Did you know
Firefox is filled with features designed to give you even more control over your personal information
This feature minimizes the ability of hidden third parties to track your browsing activity across many sites
Give it a try
This toolbar option removes browsing information from your computer after the fact Use it when you’ve visited a site that you don’t want in your history
Privacy Addons
The Mozilla privacy team has put together a collection of Firefox addons to help you manage your privacy online
With this feature enabled your browser will tell social sharing services publishers analytics providers advertisers and third party networks that you want to optout of tracking
Mozilla was the first company to include a Do Not Track feature when it was added to Firefox in 
Since then it has been adopted by most major browsers though many companies on the receiving end of the requests are still not honoring them
Efforts are being made by Web advocacy groups to have this changed

These include your history searches and cookies
