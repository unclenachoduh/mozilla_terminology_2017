JavaScript allocated too many times and forced a garbage collection
There was an API call to force garbage collection
The cycle collector required a garbage collection
A global object that was thought to be dead at the start of the GC cycle was revived by the end of the GC cycle
ComponentsutilsforceGC was called to force a garbage collection
GC due to Zeal debug settings
Firefox destroyed a JavaScript runtime or context and this was the final garbage collection before shutting down
Received an inter-process message that requested a garbage collection
The user was inactive for a long time Took the opportunity to perform GC when it was unlikely to be noticed
The worker was idle for a relatively long time
JavaScript returned to the event loop and there were enough bytes allocated since the last GC that a new GC cycle was triggered
Work needed to be done on the tenured heap requiring the nursery to be empty
JavaScript returned to the event loop and it has been a relatively long time since we performed a garbage collection
There were too many properties on tenured objects whose value was an object in the nursery
A full non-incremental garbage collection was triggered because there was a faster rate of allocations than the existing incremental garbage collection cycle could keep up with
There has been a relatively long time since the last incremental GC slice
JavaScript attempted to allocate but there was no memory available Doing a full compacting garbage collection as an attempt to free up memory for the allocation
The document finished loading
There was very low memory available
JavaScript allocated enough new objects in the nursery that it became full and triggered a minor GC
The tab or window was moved to the background
JavaScript returned to the event loop and it has been a relatively long time since Firefox performed a garbage collection
The active incremental GC cycle was forced to finish immediately
The page has been navigated to a new document
A large allocation was requested but there was not enough memory
JavaScript allocated too many bytes and forced a garbage collection
The user was inactive for a long time Firefox took the opportunity to perform GC when it was unlikely to be noticed
